# Tools that I will be using to build the api
1. Express - is one of the most popular web frameworks for node.js. It is built on top of the node.js HTTP module and adds support for routing, middleware, view system, etc. It is very simple and minimal, unlike other frameworks that try to do way too much, thereby reducing the flexibility for developers to have their own design choices.
2. Mongoose - is an ODM (Object Document Mapping) tool for Node.js and MongoDB. It helps you convert the objects in your code to documents in the database and vice versa. Mongoose provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
3. CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) - It is a set of operations we get servers to execute.
